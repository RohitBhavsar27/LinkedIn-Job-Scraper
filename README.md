# Easy Hunt - LinkedIn Job Scraper Bot
An intelligent web scraping application designed to automate the process of finding job listings on LinkedIn. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to search for jobs based on role and location, apply advanced filters, and visualize the results. The project is containerized with Docker for reliable and consistent deployment.

## Overview
Manually searching for jobs on LinkedIn can be a repetitive and time-consuming task. This project was built to streamline that process by providing a simple web interface to scrape job data programmatically. The application uses Selenium to control a web browser, navigates to LinkedIn, performs the specified search, and parses the results into a clean, usable format.

The entire application is wrapped in a Streamlit UI and containerized using Docker, which solves common deployment challenges related to browser and driver compatibility in cloud environments.

## Features
- Dynamic Job Search: Scrape jobs based on any job role and comma-separated locations.

- Experience Level Filtering: Narrow down the search results by selecting one or more experience levels (e.g., "Entry level", "Mid-Senior level").

- Data Cleaning: Automatically removes duplicate job listings based on the job title, company, and application link.

- Sorted Results: The final list of jobs is sorted by post date, showing the most recent listings first.

- Data Visualization: Includes a bar chart showing the top 20 companies with the most job openings for the searched role.

- CSV Export: Download the cleaned and sorted job data as a CSV file for offline analysis.

- Containerized Deployment: Uses a Dockerfile to ensure the application and all its dependencies (including the correct browser version) run consistently anywhere.
